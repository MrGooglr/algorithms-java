    <h1>Data Structures and Algorithms using Java</h1>
</div>

## Hello and welcome
Some points that are needed to understand are: 
1. Java Version used is 14.0.1.
1. Data Structure is used which seems better as per the algorithm that we are going to implement.
1. Time Complexity analysis has been done and documented.


## Stable Vs. Unstable Sort Alogrithms

When we have duplicate values in the Data that we are sorting then the concept of Stable or Unstable comes in picture. The question that comes is ***"When we do the sorting, is the original position of the duplicate elements be preserved in sorted data?"***

Those algorithms that preserve the order after sorting are the ***Stable*** while others are ***Unstable***.

> Stable sorting algos are preferable.
